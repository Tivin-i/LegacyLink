# Contributing to LegacyLink

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **LegacyLink**! As a self-hosted, local-first system, the strength of this project relies on the community making it more resilient and versatile.

## Our Philosophy
LegacyLink is built to ensure that documentation survives and stays accessible for the long term. Because of the sensitive and personal nature of legacy data, we prioritize:
* **Privacy-First:** Local-only by default.
* **Sustainability:** Code that is easy to maintain.
* **Transparency:** Source-available code under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**.

## How to "Commit Back"
While our license allows you to modify the code for personal and non-commercial use, we strongly encourage you to share those improvements back with the main project. 

If you’ve fixed a bug, added a local-first sync feature, or improved the UI:
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Create a branch** for your feature or fix.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with a clear description of your changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By contributing to LegacyLink, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0** terms.
